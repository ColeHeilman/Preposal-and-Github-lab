You're mission is to diffuse the bomb before time runs out. You will have 60 seconds to answer 10 questions correctly. If either you answer incorrectly or,  misspell your answer, the bomb will automatically detonate. Both speed and accuracy are needed if you are to succeed in diffusing the bomb. Each time you successfully diffuse the bomb, you will recieve a point. Compete to see who can score the most points. Good luck.
