## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?


Our first idea is to make a board game using pygame that is similar to CandyLand but we would change the themes and get creative with the different spots and actions on the board.

The second idea that we had was to program the card game Go Fish but we would add twists to the gameplay where you can steal peoples cards if you collect the jokers and be able to do
certain things within the game when you collect four of a kind of high number cards.


## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?


Our group members are Cole Heilman and Kale Wiley.


## Do you have any questions of your own?


What is the best resource we can use to familiarize ourselves with pygame?
